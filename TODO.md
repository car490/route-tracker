## Tech debt / refactors

- [ ] `dashboard/src/features/route-planner/RoutePlannerPage.jsx` (1,051 lines)
  is a single monolithic component — route/timetable state, stop management,
  map interaction, BODS fields, departures, and save logic all in one function
  body with little internal separation. Worth splitting into sub-components
  deliberately (not opportunistically), with careful manual verification of
  the whole Route Planner flow afterward given how much shared mutable state
  (stops, routeResult, hqLocation, etc.) flows between those pieces.
